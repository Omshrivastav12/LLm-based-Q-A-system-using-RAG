LLMs are very powerful though they are not trained on all the data, If we want some information about something on that LLMs are not trained then theyâ€™ll fail to provide accurate information.
  =>LLMs knowledge base is limited to the training data
  =>LLMs predict or extrapolate answers when facts are not available.
=>Solution:-
        Fine-tune LLM on that data.
        Using RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Vector Data-Base.

# RAG-based Q/A System using LLM

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Question Answering (Q/A) system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). The system leverages the capabilities of LLMs to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers by combining retrieval techniques with generative models.

## What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs can perform a variety of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering.

### Current Trends in LLMs

- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Modern LLMs have improved in understanding and generating text, making them more effective in various applications.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-trained models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Mistral are widely used for their powerful text generation capabilities.
- **Customization**: LLMs can be fine-tuned or customized for specific tasks or domains to improve performance and relevance.

### Examples of LLMs

- **Mistral**: An open-weight, large-scale language model known for its efficiency and performance in various NLP tasks.
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Developed by OpenAI, GPT models are widely recognized for their text generation capabilities and have been used in various applications from chatbots to content creation.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that enhances the capabilities of generative models by combining them with retrieval mechanisms. It consists of the following components:

1. **Retrieval Component**: This component searches for relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. It uses techniques such as semantic search or keyword matching.

2. **Generative Component**: After retrieving relevant information, the generative component, often an LLM, produces a coherent and contextually appropriate response based on the retrieved documents.

3. **Fusion Mechanism**: This mechanism integrates the retrieved information with the generative model's output, ensuring that the final response is both accurate and contextually relevant.


## LLM Integration with RAG for Response Enhancement

Integrating LLMs with RAG involves the following steps:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Use the retrieval component to fetch relevant documents or data related to the userâ€™s query. This step ensures that the generative model has access to pertinent information.

2. **Response Generation**: Feed the retrieved information into the LLM to generate a response. The LLM uses its understanding of the context and the retrieved data to produce a more accurate and relevant answer.

3. **Response Enhancement**: Combine the output from the generative model with the retrieved data to enhance the response further. This integration ensures that the final answer is comprehensive and contextually appropriate.

By leveraging RAG with LLMs, the Q/A system can provide more accurate, contextually relevant, and insightful responses to user queries.



## How to Run the Project

This project implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using a combination of retrieval and generation techniques. The implementation is based on the `Merged_Papers_RAG.pdf` dataset and the corresponding notebook.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omshrivastav12/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies from the `Requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open and run the RAG implementation notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook RAG_implementation.ipynb
```

This will start the notebook in your browser. Execute the cells to see the RAG model in action.

### 5. Using Custom PDF Files

The notebook currently uses the `Merged_Papers_RAG.pdf` file for the RAG implementation. If you want to use your own documents for retrieval, simply replace this file with your own PDFs.

### 6. Model Outputs

The RAG model will retrieve relevant information from the provided documents and generate answers based on the input query. After running the notebook, you will be able to visualize the results within the notebook.

Welcome to the **RAG-Based Question Answering System**! This project combines the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to build a high-performance Q/A system that provides accurate, contextually relevant answers to user queries. 

## 🛠 Project Overview

This project uses **RAG** to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models by pairing retrieval methods with generation techniques. By first retrieving relevant information, we allow the model to generate responses that are highly precise and deeply contextual. 🌟

## 💡 What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

An **LLM** is an AI model trained on extensive text data, giving it the ability to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are versatile in handling tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and Q/A.

### 🔥 Current Trends in LLMs

- **Enhanced Text Understanding**: Modern LLMs have advanced in text comprehension, allowing for more accurate responses across applications.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Popular models like **GPT** and **Mistral** provide foundational capabilities for a variety of NLP tasks.
- **Customizable**: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains to improve performance.

### 🏆 Examples of Popular LLMs

- **Mistral**: Known for efficient, large-scale language processing, useful in many NLP applications.
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Widely recognized and used for applications like chatbots, Q/A systems, and content creation.

## 🔍 What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines retrieval and generation to enhance accuracy. Here’s how RAG works:

1. **Retrieval Component**: Locates relevant information in a document corpus using semantic search or keyword matching.
2. **Generative Component**: Uses an LLM to generate a coherent response based on retrieved documents.
3. **Fusion Mechanism**: Merges retrieved information with generated content to ensure responses are accurate and contextually relevant.

---

## ⚙️ How Does RAG Integrate with LLMs?

Combining RAG with LLMs involves three main steps:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch relevant documents or content for the user’s query.
2. **Response Generation**: Pass retrieved data to an LLM for response generation, utilizing both context and data to provide accurate answers.
3. **Response Fusion**: Enhance the response by fusing generated text with retrieved information, ensuring answers are well-rounded and insightful.

This integration enables our Q/A system to deliver highly accurate and contextually relevant responses. 🎯

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

### 1. Hugging Face API Key for Mistral 7B

To use the **Mistral 7B** model, you will need an API key from Hugging Face. You can obtain the key by signing up on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/). After getting the API key, ensure it's set up in your environment for model access.

### 2. Weaviate Database API Key

This project utilizes a **Weaviate** database for semantic search. To access the Weaviate API, you will need an API key. Sign up at [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) and generate an API key to integrate with the project for document retrieval.

### 3. Python and Required Libraries

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine. The necessary libraries will be installed from the `requirements.txt` file after setting up the environment.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the RAG-based Q/A system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omshrivastav12/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Setting up a virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated and easy to manage.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Now, open the **Jupyter Notebook** to interact with the RAG model.

```bash
jupyter notebook RAG_implementation.ipynb
```

The notebook will open in your browser. Run the cells in sequence to see the RAG model in action! 🎉

### 5. Using Custom PDF Files

This implementation currently uses a file named `Merged_Papers_RAG.pdf` for document retrieval. To use your own documents, replace this file with your PDFs. You’ll see how RAG retrieves relevant information to answer queries based on your custom documents.

### 6. 📈 Model Outputs

The RAG model retrieves information from the documents and generates answers based on the input query. View these results directly in the notebook as the model performs retrieval and generation.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Combines Retrieval and Generation**: RAG provides an optimal balance between data retrieval and generative responses, leveraging the best of both worlds.
- **Customizable Document Corpus**: Swap in your own PDFs to personalize the Q/A system.
- **Insightful Results**: Achieve highly accurate, contextually enriched answers thanks to RAG and LLM integration.
